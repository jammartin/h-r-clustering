# Clustering of Hertzsprung-Russel-Data
This repository holds some code and a jupyter notebook dedicated to find clusters in the famous 
Hertzsprung-Russel-Diagram. To find the clusters, two basic clustering algorithms are applied:
1. K-means
2. DBSCAN

The jupyter notebook includes simple implementations as well as code snippets applying the algorithms of the 
[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package. 

The code included in the `pkg` folder is useful for generating the plots as`.png` files.
